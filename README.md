### AI Exercise Repetition Counter
AI Exercise Repetition Counter is a Python-based project that uses computer vision to track and count exercise repetitions. By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system can accurately detect body movements and provide real-time feedback to help users track their workout performance.

## Features
Real-time exercise repetition counting.
Supports various exercises (e.g., push-ups, squats, bicep curls) through customizable movement detection.
Uses computer vision and pose estimation for accuracy.
Simple to set up and run on any system with a camera.
## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
OpenCV: Computer vision library for image processing.
MediaPipe: Framework for real-time pose detection and body landmark tracking.
